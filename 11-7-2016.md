# Machine Learning
* Started Repo for implementing Algorithims
    * finish k-means code because I remembered the algorithim
    * need to write pages in and make it a nice study
    * maybe I can publish it as a book later
* Leetcode Videos
    * Made one more today
    * Maybe start website over winter Break, will have over 30 at that point
    * Maybe start videos talking about Data Structures in Python
* Vim
    * `:put =range(11,15)` build a range from 11 to 15
